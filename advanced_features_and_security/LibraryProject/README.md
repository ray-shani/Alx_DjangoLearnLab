# Permissions and Groups Setup Guide:
# 1. Add custom permissions to models using the Meta class.
# 2. Create groups (Editors, Viewers, Admins) in Django Admin.
# 3. Assign permissions (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete) to groups in the admin interface.
# 4. Use @permission_required decorator in views to enforce permissions.
# 5. Test by creating test users, assigning them to groups, and verifying access to views.

# To test, create users in the admin panel, assign them to groups, and try accessing views.
