### Delete Operation

**Python Command:**

```python
from bookshelf.models import Book

# Assuming the book to delete has ID 1 (from the create step).
# In a real shell session, you would use the actual ID of the book you want to delete.
book_to_delete = Book.objects.get(id=1)

# Delete the book instance from the database
book_to_delete.delete()
print(f"Book with ID 1 deleted.")

# Confirm deletion by trying to retrieve all books again
all_books_after_deletion = Book.objects.all()
print(f"Number of books remaining: {all_books_after_deletion.count()}")
if not all_books_after_deletion:
    print("No books found in the database.")
else:
    for book in all_books_after_deletion:
        print(book)

Expected Output:

Book with ID 1 deleted.
Number of books remaining: 0
No books found in the database.
